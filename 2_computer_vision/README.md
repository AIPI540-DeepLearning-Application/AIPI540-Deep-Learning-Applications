# Computer vision
This directory contains notebooks which introduce several of the foundational approaches and architectures used to solve problems in computer vision.  These notebooks should be run on GPU.

The directory contains the following demo notebooks:  
- **CNNs**  
    - **cnn_basics**  
        - introduces the use of convolutional neural networks for image classification  
    - **cnn_w_tensorboard**  
        - demonstrates the use of TensorBoard with PyTorch to track and visualize metrics on the model training and performance
    - **transfer_learning**  
        - demonstrates how to use pre-trained models and conduct fine tune training for image classification problems  


- **object_detection**  
    - **YOLO**  
        - demonstrates use of YOLO using a pre-trained model for object detection on images and webcam capture
    - **Detectron2**  
        - demo of object detection, keypoint prediction and image segmentation using the Detectron2 model
